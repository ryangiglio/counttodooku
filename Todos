  duplicated code to find the index in the todos reducer 
    This is because I have to access by ID instead of index since I'm splitting the list into 2 and the indexes don't match

  Weird sorting once something has been completed
    Todo items that are created while there are complete items behave weirdly. An item created while at least one item is completed will become "stuck" to the bottom slot. If you drag it around, it can rearrange the order of the items under it, but will return to the bottom slot if you let go. 

    Steps to reproduce:

        create four items a-d
        create item e
        complete item e
        create item f
        attempt to drag f to the top. This fails, and item f pops back to the bottom
        attempt to drag f to the top again. this time the items under it shift, but f returns to the bottom
        attempt to drag f to the top. As in step 5, no effect.
        attempt to drag f to the top. As in 6. shifting.


    Things get even weirder if you create multiple new items while an item is completed. Items will be "stuck" to their slots as above. However, items that are pushed above their stuck slots via the "shifting" method illustrated in steps 6 and 8 above will behave normally. The previously normal items, now pushed into "stuck" slots" will remain stuck there unless shifted out. 

    Steps to reproduce: 

        create four items a-d
        create item e
        complete item e
        create 2 items f and g
        try to move f. no effect
        try to move g. shifting effect
        use the shifting effect to move item d above any item a-d.
        promote item f to the top slot, no problem.
        try to move the item in the second to last slot but always put it back where it was. This either has no effect or moves freely among every slot but the last. The effect changes every other time you attempt to drag it
