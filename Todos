Style all the things

Refactor
  Split into Complete and Incomplete lists
    This would be a whole refactor of the Redux system b/c all the reducers etc would break

  duplicated code to find the index in the todos reducer 
    This is because I have to access by ID instead of index since I'm splitting the list into 2 and the indexes don't match
    The above would fix


BUGS
  Seconds don't save when the user backgrounds the tab and then closes without revisiting

  Reordering is broken for items that have been checked off and then un-checked because they don't get moved back up in the array
