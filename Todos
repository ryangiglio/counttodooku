Style all the things

Drag to reorder (MOST COMPLICATED)
  React DnD seems most popular
  Simple Sortable Example https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/examples-sortable-simple.html

  need to abstract out each todo list OL into its own component so they can both be wrapped in separate dragdropcontexts. shouldn't be able to drag and drop things in between the two lists
  also need to figure out how to handle "merging" the final results since the're coming from one place. Putting things at their index in the list won't work. for example
    one
    two
    three

    (comp)
    four
    five
    six

    if you drag six above five, it'll be index 1 in that list but still should be index 4 in the overall list.
