Style all the things

Credit/About page

Refactor/clean up/comment code
  duplicated code to find the index in the todos reducer 

  addtodoform de-inline the handler

Add listener to tick so it saves when the user changes tabs in addition to when they close the page

BUGS
  WHen an item is sorted off of #1, it's not saving its seconds
